## Description
Project 19 tasked the student with building out an employee tracker using React as the main library with the funcationality to search for employees by name as well as order the list by one data type.

Once stylized, I then used the randomuser.me API to generate an array of random people objects which are then populated into the application via the Map method on the Employee Card component. Cards are arranged using CSS Grid to ensure responsive design for the grid if the display is collapsed.

Lastly, I added a search bar and age ordering functionality to meet the requirements of the assignment. The searchbar uses a dynamic search functionality where it actively searches on change of the text in the search bar. The ordering buttons will reorder the page based on the age of the employee.
